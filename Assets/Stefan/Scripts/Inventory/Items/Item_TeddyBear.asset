  itemDescription: "[He finds a small teddy bear wedged against the garage door,
    among some other toys]\r\n\t\t*Oh, buddy. You weren't supposed to be out here.
    You're supposed to be inside, waiting on the shelf in the nursery. In the room
    with angels and clouds painted on the ceiling*.\r\n\t\t[Picks up the teddy bear
    and inspects it for a bit]\r\n\t\t*Cassandra's mother gave you to us. \"For when
    the baby comes\", she said. The unfairness of it all, it's devastating*\r\n\t\t*I
    kept telling Cassandra that we should donate these things. The clothes still
    in packages, the little baby boy boots and toys we never used. It's so hard,
    for both of us, to give something like this away, when this is all we have left
    of him*\r\n\t\t[He holds the bars close for a while, then puts it in one of his
    jacket pockets]\r\n\t\t*You're not trash little one, you are a memory, I will
    not leave you here.*\r\n"
