  itemDescription: "[While blowing leaves off of the flower bed, he finds a bunch
    of shattered pieces of china]\r\n\t\t*Cassandra's aunt gave us this. \"For growing
    your family\", she wrote on the card that came with this gift. A wonderful, hand
    painted antique set of china.*\r\n\t\t[Picks up a shard]\r\n\t\t*We were so careful
    with this thing. Wrapped in a million newspapers and pieces of bubble wrap like
    it was the last china set on the planet. This antiquity survived for decades,
    if not more than century, just to be lost in a matter of seconds, when our frustration
    and anger grew too big to contain. None of this was fair to us, so why should
    we care about this old thing?*"
