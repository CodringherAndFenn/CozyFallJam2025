  itemDescription: "[He walks back towards the house and looks at the picture at
    the doorway]\r\n\t\t*But here we are now. Six months in, again. We haven't told
    anyone. We probably won't for a while. We're not buying anything. Not planning
    anything. Not hoping too hard, because hope, we've learned, is a dangerous thing.\r\n\t\tThat
    couple in this picture loved each other enough to try for a child. And we...
    we still have that love. Bruised. Scared. But still here. Still choosing each
    other every morning when it would be easier to just... let go.\r\n\t\tOne day
    at a time, one heartbeat at a time."
