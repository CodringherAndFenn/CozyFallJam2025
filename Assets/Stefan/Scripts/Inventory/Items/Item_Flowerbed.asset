  itemDescription: "[He looks at what is now a mostly withered flower bed]\r\n\t\t*Cassandra
    spent 3 months on this. Researched every flower, evert color combination. \"Perennials\"
    she said. \"They last for years and years and come back and bloom every year,
    so the baby can watch them grow, season after season.*\r\n\t\t*Roses for love,
    forget-me-nots for memory. Daisies because they were cheerful and \"perfect for
    little hands to pick\". She planted them the week we found out. Like she was
    putting down roots for all of us.\r\n\t\tThey bloomed, for a while. And then
    he died soon after he was born, so they died too soon after. Its been two autumns
    now, and you can see what's left of them.\r\n\t\tNow she walks past it. Looks
    away as if to ignore it, maybe to stop reminding her of what we lost.*\r\n"
