  itemDescription: 'Character spots a few wet, white envelopes underneath some leaves.
    You can see they are hospital bills, insurance bills, personal letters and whatnot

    There
    they are, still sealed and in the same place as last year. Its a surprise you
    can still make out some of the writing on them.

    Funny thing about these
    things. Once you read them, once you open them, they''re real, as real as it
    gets. "We regret to inform you.""Our deepest condolences." Words that made us
    realize that its true.

    Cassandra couldn''t get herself to read the letters,
    not even the ones from our family."For closure" i kept telling her, but is there
    any closure, really? Nursery is still there, playground is there, and she is
    still dead. That will not change, not with all the closure in the world
