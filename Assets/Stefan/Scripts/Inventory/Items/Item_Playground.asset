  itemDescription: "[He stops at the swing set, covered in leaves]\r\n\t\t*I built
    this in July. Thirty-five degree weather, breaking my back in the heat. Cassandra
    was bringing me a refresher from time to time and laughing at my suffering.*\r\n\t\t*The
    swing's never been swung and the slide's never been slid. And the worst part?
    Im starting to forget what hope felt like. That feeling when you're building
    something for the future, when you believe good things are coming, when you can
    see past next week or next month. Now I'm just here, waiting for the days to
    pass, going through motions, thinking what was it all for?*"
