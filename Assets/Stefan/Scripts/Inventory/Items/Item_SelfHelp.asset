  itemDescription: "[On the coffee table, next to the sunchairs, he uncovers a stack
    of wate and sun-damaged books. He flips a bit through the soggy pages]\r\n\t\t*Chapter
    Seven: \"Recognizing your Grief patterns. Chapter twelve: \"Moving forward without
    moving on.\" There's a whole industry, isn't there? Grief Incorporated. Everyone
    seems to have a roadmap to guide you through this hell, as if there is some predetermined
    route that you can set and your destination will certainly come with the promise
    of healing.*\r\n\t\t*If I had just read these books before.. had we just gone
    to the support group that Cassandra mentioned.. If I had been more attentive
    during the pregnancy, noticed something sooner, pushed the doctors harder..*\r\n\t\t[He
    stops himself]\r\n\t\t*Therapist said this is normal, the \"if only\" game. If
    only we had chosen a different hospital. If only we'd waited another year.  Maybe
    there was a checklist somewhere that i missed, a form i didn't fill out correctly
    in order to be accepted in becoming a father. Sad that books dont have that chapter,
    \"How to negotiate with God.\". Maybe then, he would have lived.*"
