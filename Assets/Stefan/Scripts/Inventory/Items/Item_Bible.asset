  itemDescription: "[He finds Cassandra's Bible]\r\n\t\t*Cassandra's had been reading
    a lot of Job back then. I used to be able to tell by the tear stained pages.
    \"The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.\"\r\n\t\tBut here's what I never
    understood, WHAT did he actually give us? Nine months of hope? Ultrasound pictures
    that look like old TV static? That was not giving, it was dangling a treat in
    front of a hungry child. That was showing someone the promised land and then
    burning it in front of them.*\r\n\t\t[He opens to a passage marked by his wife]\r\n\t\t*\"Before
    i formed you in the womb, I knew you\". Then why didn't You save him? If You
    knew him, if You had plans for him, if You counted every hair on his head before
    they was hair to count, where were YOU when we needed YOU?*\r\n\t\t*The pastor
    said, \"God needed another angel.\" I almost hit him, I wanted to scream in anger.
    We needed a CHILD more than he needed an \"angel\". But instead I nodded. Shook
    his hand and thanked him for the casserole*."
